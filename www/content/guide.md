# Guide

These are some guides for helping you create your first commands and deploying your bots.

These guides assume that you know generally what a computer is and how to use TypeScript. They will use [Bun](https://bun.sh/) as the package manager/runtime, but it can be substituted for your choice (e.g. [Node](https://nodejs.org/) and NPM), and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for the language.

If you don't know how to create a bot in the Discord Dev dashboard, see [this guide from Discord.js](https://discordjs.guide/preparations/setting-up-a-bot-application.html) before continuing.
